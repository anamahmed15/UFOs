# UFOs
Use JavaScript to add dynamic elements to a webpage

# Purpose
The aim of this analysis is to create a webpage with a dynamic table which has the ability to filter data about UFO sightings based on date, location and shape.

# Results
Wheen the page loads, it automatically loads information from the "data.js" file. But, we were able to successfully implement the use of filters to yield results based on date, location and shape.
In the example below, we filtered sightings in Californnia on 01/01/2010
